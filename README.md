*Overview*

Data: We have information on 5,000 bank customers, including their age, income, accounts, and whether they took out a personal loan last year.

Problem: The bank wants to find ways to get more customers to take out personal loans without losing them as regular customers. They had a 9.6% success rate last year and want to improve it.

Goal: Use customer data to identify the best people to offer personal loans to, so the bank can spend less money and get more loans.
