# Overview

## Data: 
We have information on 5,000 bank customers, including their age, income, accounts, and whether they took out a personal loan last year.

## Problem: 
The bank wants to find ways to get more customers to take out personal loans without losing them as regular customers. They had a 9.6% success rate last year and want to improve it.

## Goal: 
Use customer data to identify the best people to offer personal loans to, so the bank can spend less money and get more loans.

## Process
1. Data cleaning to manage outliers and null values 
2. Conducted exploratory data analysis
3. Minimized skewness using IQR, Log Transformation and Power Transformation method
4. Created a model to understand which customers are the best profiles to give personal loans to or upsell using Logistic regression model
5. Cross-validation to check how well the model performs
6. Achieved a mean AUC score of 0.958 

*Note: The model was based on data analysis, demographic factors, and understanding of the financial sector.*
